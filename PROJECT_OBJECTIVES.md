# Bacteria wars project objectives

The Bacteria Wars project is a 2D game that simulates the life cycle of a blue bacteria colony. The main objective of the game is for the blue bacteria to live as long as possible by finding and consuming food. The blue bacteria character has a limited amount of energy, which decreases over time, and can only survive by replenishing it with food. The game environment includes labyrinths, which serve as natural barriers that the blue bacteria must navigate around to find food. To help blue bacteria find the most efficient path to the food, a neural net is implemented and trained to learn the labyrinth structure. The blue bacteria can also reproduce and transfer the trained neural net model to the next generation if they have enough energy to do so.

1. Create a 2D game environment for the blue bacteria to move around in. #DONE
2. Design a blue bacteria character with energy that will decrease over time and eventually lead to its death. #DONE
3. Create a food object that blue bacteria can eat to gain energy and extend its lifespan. #DONE
4. Implement a labyrinth structure in the game environment to serve as a natural barrier that blue bacteria must navigate around.
5. Develop a neural net that can be trained to learn the labyrinth structure and help blue bacteria find the most efficient path to the food.
6. Allow blue bacteria to reproduce and transfer the neural net model to the next generation if they have enough energy to do so.
